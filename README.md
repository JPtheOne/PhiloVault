# PhiloVault
Python application that retrieves and indexes documents stored on a mySQL database. The database is available on the text files. Once you've created the database on you connection, you'll be able to run the program.
Keep in mind pip installation as follows for the needed libraries:
```
pip install spacy
```
Once all the needed libraries are installed, you can execute the program, using the following command in the location of the files:
```
python "Machinery.py"
```
Machinery is the file that launches the execution of the system. Maybe in the future, it can be expanded to be launched from the GUI. Also, the database should be initialized using the SQL files provided.

Once it is installed, you should obtain a menu like this by running the Machinery file:

Might be extended later to create a functional GUI or to add more languages and documents.
